Tokalabs: sdloAssistant.py
By: Hubert Gee

A library that sends Tokalabs REST APIs from your client to the Tokalabs controller.
This repo includes a Python script that reserves and releases a sandbox called reserveSandbox.py.
This reservation script isn't the only style.  Just an example. This example takes in two args:

   1> -sandbox 
   2> -reserve or -release

The Sandbox yml file should have the followings:

   sdloControllerIp: 10.10.10.2
   user: admin
   password: password
   sandbox: gitlab-pytest

Usage:
   To reserve a sandbox: python reserveSandbox.py -sandbox testbed_1.yml -reserve
   To release a sandbox: python reserveSandbox.py -sandbox testbed_1.yml -release


The sdloAssistant.py library has many more common configuration APIs.
