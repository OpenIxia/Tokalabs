By: Hubert Gee

A library that sends Tokalabs REST APIs from your client to the Tokalabs controller.

Requirements
   - pip install requests
   - a sandbox yml file

Sandbox yml file should have the followings:
   sdloControllerIp: 10.10.10.2
   user: admin
   password: password
   sandbox: gitlab-pytest

Usage:
   To reserve a sandbox: python reserveSandbox.py -sandbox testbed_1.yml -reserve

The sdloAssistant.py library has many more common configuration APIs.
